# Inform Hate Speech

##Problem 

“Hate Speech” can occur at any mosque, church, madrassah, mandir or any religious/non-religious institution in Pakistan. This “hate speech” can occur generally against any other muslim sect, any minority group or against a particular citizen/group of Pakistan which encourage hate/violence/takfir among audience. We have been suffering for this menace in our society for too long now whether it is against Shias, Ahmadis, Wahabis, Deobandis, Christians, Army or neighboring countries.

###Legal definition of hate speech

The Pakistan Penal Code [1] also addresses hate speech in Article 153-A titled ‘Promoting enmity between different groups’

##Motivation

This idea was originated by the recent campaign of Jibran Nasir [2] against regular hate speech incidents occurring at Lal Masjid by Jamia Hafsa and Maulana Abdul Aziz. The campaign has the hashtags of #ReclaimYourMosque and #ArrestAbdulAziz which is a very valid demand and need of our time. Jibran Nasir requested all Pakistani citizens to show their support by recording video messages on facebook and asked to identify such terror generating sources in their neighborhood. 

##Proposed Solution

We can’t eradicate this problem overnight but we can start it today and involve everyone because its not a one man job. Lao Tzu once said “Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.”

There is no tool available right now to empower our society in Pakistan to register a complain against “hate speech” in their neighborhood. This brings us to a very feasible solution which involves a mobile app, a web back-end and a website. Mobile app is used to register a complain with necessary details of location and an audio recording of sermon/speech as proof along with text. It will be a community driven tool which will be first of its kind to be used by all smartphone users in Pakistan. Internet connectivity at time of reporting won’t be necessary and we’ll provide submitting facility later on once user has access to Internet.

####Supporting evidence

In a survey done by @ByteForAll in June 2014 [3], 92% of total respondents replied “yes” to having come across hate speech online, while over half (51%) indicated they had been the target of hate speech online. The survey also identifies the top victims of hate speech in Pakistan and they can be considered valid for ground truth as well. The list constitutes Shias, Ahmadis, Indians/Hindus, Atheists/unbelievers, Pillars of state (Park armed forces, Media, Judiciary, Politicians etc ), Females, LGBT, Jews, Local ethnicities (Pashtuns/Pathans, Baloch etc ) and Americans.
